# React Function Components

This post was made for developers that have certain experience building Class Components but might not have found the
time to learn Function Components and the Hooks API, or that just want to learn more about the differences and
similarities between the two.

*If you are starting from scratch I would suggest that you head to the
[official documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html).*

## Introduction

React helps us to build UIs by creating reusable components like buttons or text fields, then composing a tree the
nodes of which are instances of those components and, finally, rendering that tree.

The browser works in a similar way. When an HTML document is loaded, the rendering engine parses the HTML and converts
the elements to DOM nodes and puts them in a tree called the Content Tree and renders it.

React run-time works on top of the browser operations on the DOM by creating an in-memory representation of the tree of
elements and using a diffing algorithm to reconcile that representation with the DOM every time there is an update in
the tree. That in-memory representation is called the Virtual DOM.

**What are the advantages of using React?** Firstly, React's diffing algorithm on the Virtual DOM is super fast and
only the strictly necessary changes are committed to the sluggish HTML DOM and, secondly, React Components have a rich
API with which we can tap to different moments in the lifecycle of a component or update its internal state.

on the performance of different virtual DOMs implemented in different UI rendering libraries.*

### React components

Historically, Function Components were relegated to Stateless Components without any internal state or lifecycle logic.

```jsx
function StatelessButton({ className, size, color, children }) {
  const style = {
    backgroundColor: color,
    padding: sizeToPadding[size],
    fontSize: sizeToFontSize[size],
  };
  return (
    <button className={clsx('StatelessButton', className)} style={style}>
      {children}
    </button>
  );
}
```

If you wanted to have an internal state to keep track of the number of clicks to the button, you would have to use a
Class Component.

```jsx
class ClicksButton extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      clicks: 0,
    };
  }
  handleClick = () => {
    this.setState(({ clicks }) => ({
      clicks: clicks + 1,
    }));
  };
  render() {
    const { className, style } = this.props;
    const { clicks } = this.state;
    return (
      <button
        className={clsx('ClicksButton', className)}
        style={style}
        onClick={this.handleClick}
      >
        Clicks {clicks}
      </button>
    );
  }
}
```

Luckily enough for us, the scene changed when Facebook released React 16.8 in February 2019 packed with a new API to
hook into lifecycle events and internal state using Function Components. Enter React Hooks.

```jsx
function ClicksButton({ className, style }) {
  const [clicks, setClicks] = useState(0);
  const handleClick = useCallback(() => setClicks((clicks) => clicks + 1), []);
  return (
    <button
      className={clsx('ClicksButton', className)}
      style={style}
      onClick={handleClick}
    >
      Clicks {clicks}
    </button>
  );
}
```

## Lifecycle methods and internal state

During its life, a component instance goes through three different phases: mounting, updating and unmounting. At the
same time, every render, whether it's the first, the last or one in between, goes through three different phases:
render, pre-commit and commit.

See [this amazing diagram](https://projects.wojtekmaj.pl/react-lifecycle-methods-diagram/) to get a grasp of every step
of React's lifecycle.

### Mounting

Before rendering for the first time, components let us initialise the state, subscribe to data sources or set timers to
name a few.

Let's see how we can write a Class Component that initialises a clock and sets an interval to update the time.

```jsx
class Clock extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      time: new Date().toLocaleTimeString(),
    };
  }
  componentDidMount() {
    setInterval(() => {
      this.setState({ time: new Date().toLocaleTimeString() });
    }, 1000);
  }
  render() {
    const { className, style } = this.props;
    const { time } = this.state;
    return (
      <span
        className={clsx('Clock', className)}
        style={style}
      >
        {time}
      </span>
    );
  }
}
```

As you can see here we're are initialising the state in the constructor and then we are using the lifecycle method
***componentDidMount*** to set the interval that updates the time every second. ***componentDidMount*** will only ever
be called once in the life of a component, just before rendering for the first time.

Now, what does that look like when using Function Components and Hooks?

```jsx
function Clock({ className, style }) {
  const [time, setTime] = useState(new Date().toLocaleTimeString());
  useEffect(() => {
    setInterval(() => {
      setTime(new Date().toLocaleTimeString());
    }, 1000);
  }, []);
  return (
    <span
      className={clsx('Clock', className)}
      style={style}
    >
      {time}
    </span>
  );
}
```

Here, the ***useEffect*** hook is replacing the ***componentDidMount*** lifecycle method. Notice how ***useEffect***
receives a function as the first argument and an array as the second. As for ***useState***, it replaces the state
initialisation we had in the constructor of our Class Component. Only here, the initial value is not assigned to
***this.state***, instead, it is passed as the only argument to ***useState***.

There is a big difference in the way the state is updated too. With Class Components, we use ***this.setState*** and the
state is a map of key-value pairs. On the other hand, useState returns us an array with the current value of the state
as the first item and a setter for that value as the second. That setter is what we use to update the value.

Several built-in hooks receive a callback function for us to put some logic as the first argument and the dependencies
list that indicates to which variables the callback logic depends on as the second. In this case, our interval logic
doesn't depend on any variable, thus we pass an empty dependencies list.

### Updating

Let's add some functionality to our clock so that we can stop it with the click of a button.

```jsx
class StoppableClock extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      time: new Date().toLocaleTimeString(),
      isRunning: true,
    };
  }
  componentDidMount() {
    this.intervalId = setInterval(() => {
      this.setState({ time: new Date().toLocaleTimeString() });
    }, 1000);
  }
  componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState) {
    // Stopping clock
    if (prevState.isRunning && !this.state.isRunning) {
      clearInterval(this.intervalId);
    }
    // Re-starting clock
    if (!prevState.isRunning && this.state.isRunning) {
      this.intervalId = setInterval(() => {
        this.setState({ time: new Date().toLocaleTimeString() });
      }, 1000);
    }
  }
  toggle = () => {
    this.setState(({ isRunning }) => ({ isRunning: !isRunning }));
  }
  render() {
    const { className, style } = this.props;
    const { time } = this.state;
    return (
      <div className={clsx('StoppableClock', className)} style={style}>
        <span className="StoppableClock-time">{time}</span>
        <button className="StoppableClock-button" onClick={this.toggle}>Toggle</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

We've added several things to make our clock stoppable:
 * A new state boolean attribute called ***isRunning*** indicating whether the clock should be running or not,
 initialised to ***true***.
 * A button hooked to an event listener to toggle ***isRunning*** between ***true*** or ***false***.
 * And a ***componentDidUpdate*** lifecycle method call to act on the ***isRunning*** state change and stop or restart
 the clock.

As you can see, in the Class Component, ***componentDidUpdate*** is called immediately after updating occurs. This
creates an opportunity for us to act upon any props or state changes (updating the DOM, retrieving data, etc). In this
case, we are stopping or restarting the interval that updates the time. So, we are basically undoing what we set in
***componentDidMount*** and then setting it all again depending on which conditions on the previous and current state are met.

Let's see how we solve the same problem in a Function Component.

```jsx
function StoppableClock({ className, style }) {
  const [time, setTime] = useState(new Date().toLocaleTimeString());
  const [isRunning, setIsRunning] = useState(true);
  const toggle = useCallback(() => {
    setIsRunning(isRunning => !isRunning);
  }, []);
  useEffect(() => {
    if (isRunning) {
      const intervalId = setInterval(() => {
        setTime(new Date().toLocaleTimeString());
      }, 1000);
      return () => {
        clearInterval(intervalId);
      };
    }
  }, [isRunning]);
  return (
    <div className={clsx('StoppableClock', className)} style={style}>
      <span className="StoppableClock-time">{time}</span>
      <button className="StoppableClock-button" onClick={toggle}>Toggle</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Here, firstly, our ***isRunning*** state is added as a separate piece of state with its individual value and setter.

As a rule of thumb, it's good to group pieces of state in a map if they affect the same UI effect.

```js
// Example
const [style, setStyle] = useState({
  color: 'red',
  width: '100px'
});
```

Secondly, we've used the ***useCallback*** hook to create the event listener to stop or resume the clock every time we
click on the new button. Notice how we are using our state setter ***setIsRunning*** inside the callback and how,
instead of a value, as we did for ***setTime***, we are passing a function updater as its argument, not unlike we did
for the Class Component.

```js
const toggle = useCallback(() => {
  setIsRunning(isRunning => !isRunning);
}, []);
```

Instead, we could define our handler as follows.

```js
const toggle = useCallback(() => {
  setIsRunning(!isRunning);
}, [isRunning]);
```

But that would have two disadvantages:
 * We would have to provide ***isRunning*** in the dependencies list or else the callback would get stuck with the
 state value of the stale closure from the first render (check
 [this article](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2019/03/11/deep-dive-how-do-react-hooks-really-work/) by Netlify to know
 more).
 * And, as we are adding ***isRunning*** to the dependency list, every time ***isRunning*** would change, a new
 reference to the ***toggle*** handler would be created, thus forcing the re-render of the button receiving
 ***toggle*** as the value for the ***onClick*** prop.

And lastly, we've added a couple of things to our ***useEffect*** hook. Now we set the interval only if ***isRunning***
is ***true***. And, also, we are returning a callback function from within the if statement. That callback function is
what in React Hooks lingo is called a clean-up function and it does what it says, it cleans up whatever we've set in the
***useEffect*** callback; in this case, the interval. In other words, the ***useEffect*** hook along with its clean-up
function replace the ***componentDidUpdate*** lifecycle method of Class Components in a very convenient way.

```js
useEffect(() => {
  if (isRunning) {
    const intervalId = setInterval(() => {
      setTime(new Date().toLocaleTimeString());
    }, 1000);
    return () => {
      clearInterval(intervalId);
    };
  }
}, [isRunning]);
```

### Unmounting

As you may have noticed, we've purposely left out the necessary logic to properly unmount the Class Component. What
happens with that interval if the component gets unmounted from the DOM when the interval is still running? Well, then
we have a callback that is setting a time state of a component instance that is not mounted anymore thus we have a
memory leak (this great
[Egghead video](https://egghead.io/lessons/react-stop-memory-leaks-with-componentwillunmount-lifecycle-method-in-react)
showcases the issue). Let's fix it!

```jsx

class StoppableClock extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      time: new Date().toLocaleTimeString(),
      isRunning: true,
    };
  }
  componentDidMount() {
    this.intervalId = setInterval(() => {
      this.setState({ time: new Date().toLocaleTimeString() });
    }, 1000);
  }
  componentWillUnmount() {
    clearInterval(this.intervalId);
  }
  componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState) {
    // Stopping clock
    if (prevState.isRunning && !this.state.isRunning) {
      clearInterval(this.intervalId);
    }
    // Re-starting clock
    if (!prevState.isRunning && this.state.isRunning) {
      this.intervalId = setInterval(() => {
        this.setState({ time: new Date().toLocaleTimeString() });
      }, 1000);
    }
  }
  toggle = () => {
    this.setState(({ isRunning }) => ({ isRunning: !isRunning }));
  }
  render() {
    const { className, style } = this.props;
    const { time } = this.state;
    return (
      <div className={clsx('StoppableClock', className)} style={style}>
        <span className="StoppableClock-time">{time}</span>
        <button className="StoppableClock-button" onClick={this.toggle}>Toggle</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

Now we are clearing the interval whenever the component is unmounted by using the ***componentWillUnmount*** lifecycle
method. So, how do we do that in the case of Function Components? Well, we already did:

```js
useEffect(() => {
  if (isRunning) {
    const intervalId = setInterval(() => {
      setTime(new Date().toLocaleTimeString());
    }, 1000);
    return () => {
      clearInterval(intervalId);
    };
  }
}, [isRunning]);
```

As the clean-up function is called every render, we don't need to care about any specific logic to unmount the
component. As you can see, all three lifecycles we've seen, ***componentDidMount***, ***componentDidUpdate*** and
***componentWillUnmount***, are synthesized by the ***useEffect*** hook and its clean-up function. This is commonly the
case. It's very rare to find a component needing an unmounting logic that does not go accompanied by its counterpart
mounting and updating logic.

## Avoiding unnecessary re-renders

React is fast and React devs don't usually need to care about re-renders. But if you have ever developed a heavy
component you might have taken the hard path of avoiding unnecessary re-renders with the help of console logs,
debuggers and the React Profiler. Let's go back to the ***ClicksButton*** component and see how we can optimise it.

```jsx
class ClicksButton extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      clicks: 0,
    };
  }
  handleClick = () => {
    this.setState(({ clicks }) => ({
      clicks: clicks + 1,
    }));
  };
  render() {
    const { className, style } = this.props;
    const { clicks } = this.state;
    return (
      <button
        className={clsx('ClicksButton', className)}
        style={style}
        onClick={this.handleClick}
      >
        Clicks {clicks}
      </button>
    );
  }
}
```

What happens if the ClicksButton's parent node re-renders for some reason but it provides our instance with the same
props (***className***, ***style*** and ***children***)? Our component would be forced to re-render because there are
no checks in place to determine whether the props are the same or not.

Class Components give us the ***shouldComponentUpdate*** lifecycle method to bail out of re-rendering. It receives the
next props as the first argument and the next state as the second. And that's all we need.

```jsx
class PerfClicksButton extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      clicks: 0,
    };
  }
  shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) {
    const sameClassName = nextProps.className === this.props.className;
    const sameStyle = nextProps.style === this.props.style;
    const sameChildren = nextProps.children === this.props.children;
    const sameClicks = nextState.clicks === this.state.clicks;
    if (sameClassName && sameStyle && sameChildren && sameClicks) {
      return false;
    }
    return true;
  }
  handleClick = () => {
    this.setState(({ clicks }) => ({
      clicks: clicks + 1,
    }));
  };
  render() {
    const { className, style, children } = this.props;
    const { clicks } = this.state;
    return (
      <button
        className={clsx('ClicksButton', className)}
        style={style}
        onClick={this.handleClick}
      >
        {children} {clicks}
      </button>
    );
  }
}
```

As you can see in that very ugly ***shouldComponentUpdate*** we are shallowly comparing all three props and, also, the
***clicks*** state. If all of those are the same as before we return ***false*** and stop the rendering process.

If we are only doing shallow comparisons of previous and next props and state, React gives us a very handy class that
implements the ***shouldComponentUpdate*** method for us that we can use in place of ***Component***. It's called
***PureComponent***.

```jsx
class PerfClicksButton extends PureComponent {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      clicks: 0,
    };
  }
  handleClick = () => {
    this.setState(({ clicks }) => ({
      clicks: clicks + 1,
    }));
  };
  render() {
    const { className, style, children } = this.props;
    const { clicks } = this.state;
    return (
      <button
        className={clsx('ClicksButton', className)}
        style={style}
        onClick={this.handleClick}
      >
        {children} {clicks}
      </button>
    );
  }
}
```

So, how do we avoid unnecessary re-renders on Function Components? React provides us with a function to cache the
result of our Function Components and return the same result if the same props are provided to the component. That
function is called ***memo*** and it receives our Function Component as the first argument. See how we can accomplish
the same results with it.

```jsx
const PerfClicksButton = memo(({ className, style, children }) => {
  const [clicks, setClicks] = useState(0);
  const handleClick = useCallback(() => setClicks((clicks) => clicks + 1), []);
  return (
    <button
      className={clsx('ClicksButton', className)}
      style={style}
      onClick={handleClick}
    >
      {children} {clicks}
    </button>
  );
});
```

## Custom hooks

**So what?** You may argue… It's clear that writing Function Components using Hooks entails a lot of learning: new API,
new ways of working, syntax might not be that clear as hooks are juggling with closures in a way that is not
immediately evident, etc.

Well, the main advantage of Function Components over Class Components besides the unification of the
mount/update/unmount logic with ***useEffect*** is the possibility to create new hooks, functions that you can directly
use in your Function Components and that might be as simple or as complex as you may need. Let's see an example.

```jsx
export default function useData(initData) {
  const [data, setData] = useState(initData);
  useEffect(() => {
    const intervalId = setInterval(async () => {
      const newData = await fetch('https://data-api.com/getData').then(response => response.json());
      setData(newData);
    }, 50000);
    return () => {
      clearInterval(intervalId);
    };
  }, []);
  return data;
}
```

In this simple hook, we are retrieving data from an endpoint and setting an interval to get fresh data every 50 seconds.
This hook can be used in any Function Component.

## Conclusions

Before finishing I would like to emphasise that although I am very biased towards the use of Functional Components I
recognise refactoring perfectly working Class Components into Functional Components just because they are the new
shiny thing might not be a very good thing to do from the business perspective, or the engineering perspective for that
matter.

**Take-aways:**
 * Function Components with Hooks are quite a re-vamp of the way we used to work when writing Class Component and it
 might be difficult to make the switch.
 * The API for dealing with mounting, updating and unmounting logic is much more synthetic with ***useEffect***.
 * Everything you do with Class Components can be done with Hooks.
 * You can encapsulate logic in custom hooks and re-use it in as many components as you wish in a very direct manner.
 * You'll probably save some lines of code if you go functional.
